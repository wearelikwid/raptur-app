RAPTUR - DJ Mix Generator for macOS
============================================

FIRST TIME OPENING THE APP
--------------------------
Since Raptur is not distributed through the Mac App Store, macOS may 
block it from opening the first time. Here's how to open it:

Method 1 (Recommended):
1. Right-click (or Control+click) on Raptur.app
2. Select "Open" from the menu
3. Click "Open" in the dialog that appears
4. The app should now launch

If Method 1 doesn't work, use Method 2:

Method 2 (System Settings):
1. Double-click Raptur.app (it will be blocked)
2. Open System Settings (or System Preferences on older macOS)
3. Go to "Privacy & Security"
4. Scroll down to find a message about Raptur being blocked
5. Click "Open Anyway"
6. Enter your password if prompted
7. Click "Open" in the confirmation dialog

After opening the app once using either method, macOS will remember 
your choice and you can open it normally in the future.
